## APP: Day Dream Bucketlist

This fullstack application allows users to add to their bucketlist wishes that can be marked as incomplete or complete. Users can also view, add, edit, and delete bucketlist wishes. The database is coded in PostgreSQL, the back-end was built using Express, and React was used for the front-end. A dark theme toggle was implemented, as well as full mobile view support, and responsive CSS.

### Overview

#### User Stories:

1. As a user, I can view my bucketlist wishes.
1. As a user, I can add, edit, and delete my wishes.
1. As a user, I can mark a wish as complete or incomplete.
1. As a user, I get related wishes I may be interested in.
1. As a user, I can toggle between light and dark mode.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the folder directory and `cd` into your back-end repo copy.
1. Fork and clone this repo into the parent folder directory (add `frontend` to the title to differentiate from the backend repo).

> **Note**: Your `backend` directory should be adjacent to your `frontend` directory. Both should be their own git repositories. The top-level parent folder should **NOT** be a git repository.

#### Front-end Setup

It would be best if you opened a new terminal tab dedicated to running and developing your front-end.

- `cd` into your frontend repo
- `touch .env` to create your .env file and paste the following:

**.env**

```
REACT_APP_API_URL = http://localhost:3005
```

- `npm install` - install npm packages listed in `package.json`.
- `npm start` - make sure your React app can start
